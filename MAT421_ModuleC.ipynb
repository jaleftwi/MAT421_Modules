        "---\n",
        "As a basic foundational knowledge- the 'root' or oftentimes the 'zero' is the value x\\* of a function f(x) such that f(x\\*) = 0. Roots are one of the most important properties of a function. As many engineers and mathematicians are well aware- root finding is essential in the processes of optimization and problem solving.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, the difficulty of root finding can vary from function to function. While f(x) = x - 10 can easily be solved for x = 10 when f(x) = 0, and though techniques to find precise roots exist for quadratic polynomial functions such as the 'quadratic formula'; most functions do not possess a convenient analytic method to obtain a precise root.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this purpose, several methods to approximate roots have been formulated to best identify a close solution. While there are be functions that do not have roots absolutely, many of these methods are adept in finding roots in even the most complicated functions in which roots do indeed exist."

Since these methods are not purely 'analytic' in that they do not always determine exact solutions; they do however produce approximations of varying degrees of accuracy that are 'close enough' to the true solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "As consequence of these approximations, some deviation or error is bound to occur. For this reason, in using these methods we must carefully consider the tolerance we wish to accept. Tolerance is in this defintion: the level of error that is found acceptable within the scope of the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "A solution is considered acceptable when the error produced between the approximate and true solutions are within the set level of tolerance. In this case, |f(x*)| < tolerance is the 'check' used to determine validity. However, other methods opt to use the deviation between two approximate solutions as the means to prove validity. In this case, |xi+1 - xi| < tolerance is represented with 'i' signifying a single iteration of the process used to deteremine the root."

        "At its basis, the bisection method utilizes a concept known as the intermediete value theorem. According to the theorem: if f(x) is a continuous function and there exists a,b (a < b) such that f(a) and f(b) are opposite in sign (one is positive and one is negative), then there exists a 'c' such that a < c < b  in which f(c) = 0. Therefore, somewhere between a and b exists a value which would be a root of the function.\n",

The initial midpoint will often not be suitable as the approximate soltuion, in which case the value m will either replace a (f(a) > 0 and f(m) > 0) as the 'upper bound' of the range or replace b (f(b) < 0 and f(b) < 0) as the 'lower bound' of the range. Once replaced, the midpoint is taken again, and the process continues until tolerance is reached.\n",
